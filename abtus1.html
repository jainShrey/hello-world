<p style=" padding:5px; margin-top:10px;"> The Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers is a nation-wide society for all personnel related to the Chemical Engineering domain, be it from academia, research or industry. Initiated in a small room at Jadavpur University, Kolkata by Dr. Hira Lal and a few other pioneers of the Chemical Engineering world in India, the society was formed when a need was felt to help simplify communication between the diverse personnel involved in this vast domain. <br>
  <br>
  Within a span of nearly seven decades, IIChE has risen to numbers of over 15,000 members, 38 regional centers and over hundred student chapters and is now considered to be at the peak of professional bodies that bring together people of similar interests toward the chemical engineering world. <br>
  <br>
  Headquartered at Jadavpur University, the activities of the Institute are spread across the country through its 33 regional centers and student chapters.
  The regional centers promote and complement the activities and objectives of the Institute within their respective territorial limits, by organizing meetings, conferences and seminars; arranging workshops, refresher courses and counseling sessions; promoting research; guiding Chemical Engineering students in career planning; and initiating any other activities which are of social, technical and professional relevance to their members.
  They serve as open fora for their members who regularly gather for informal get togethers and exchange of notes. The Regional Centers also confer awards, prizes and scholarships. <a href="http://www.iiche.org.in/">more</a><br>
