<p style=" margin-left:180px; text-align:justify;">In a high-ranking university like UPES, it is with pride that we claim the Department of Chemical Engineering of UPES to be one of the cornerstones of this college. One of the oldest departments of the University, it houses some of the most powerful and esteemed names in the Indian Chemical Engineering domain. With a number of 26 members, all of whom are degree-holders from IITs and the best-known colleges for Chemical Engineering around the world, the department strives to meet the demand for budding Chemical Engineers by training young minds in the ways of the sciences.<br>
  <br>
  Headed by <strong>Dr. I.D. Mall</strong> who has made his mark by winning the widely acclaimed Russel Ackoff award and the distinction of being the previous HOD of IIT Roorkee, the department has seen its members winning various prestigious awards like the esteemed Petrotech Lifetime Achievement award to <strong>Dr. S.J. Chopra</strong> for his outstanding contribution to the development of the Petroleum Industry in India and the multiple Fellowships like the FASc, FNASc, FNAE, etc. bestowed upon <strong>Dr. S.K Gupta</strong> for his reckonable work in the fields of Polymer Engineering and Multi-Objective Optimization using Evolutionary Algorithms.</p>

The Chemical Engineering department works to bring up applicants for the ChemE department by indulging in the following courses: 
<br><br>
<div class="branch">
<a name="branch">
<h4 style="margin-top:0px;">B.Tech in Chemical Engineering with specialization in Refining and Petrochemicals</h4>
<img src="../Images/About Us/refinery.jpg" width="300" height="150" style="margin:10px; margin-left:20px; margin-top:-10px; margin-right:29px;">
This course includes systematic designing and operations of process systems for the extraction, transformation and recovery of economically useful materials for commercial use by the public. The program strives to develop industry centric engineers with a wide knowledge in Petrochemicals and Petroleum industry.<br><br><br><br>	<br><br><br>
<h4>B.Tech in Applied Petroleum Engineering with Specialization in Gas</h4>
<img src="../Images/About Us/gas.jpg" width="300" height="150" style="margin:10px; margin-left:20px; margin-top:-10px; margin-right:29px;">
This program intends to mold students into professionals who are fit to take on engineering responsibilities that come with being a part of the Gas Industry- a specialization that has seen a great demand in the recent years. The program is designed to help understand and apply best global practices in the fields of natural gas processing, gas transportation and gas utilization techniques. Specific upstream activities that encompass exploration, reservoir and production are also taught to the students. The collective knowledge of both upstream and downstream activities and processes helps one stand out from the vast number of engineers. 
<br>
<h4>M.Tech in Chemical Engineering with Specialization in Process Design Engineering </h4>
<img src="../Images/About Us/how-to-find-entry-level-chemical-engineering-jobs.jpg" width="300" height="150" style="margin:10px; margin-left:20px; margin-top:-10px; margin-right:29px;">
The course inculcates professionals who have the domain knowledge of various processes involved in the Chemical/Petroleum/Petrochemical industries and methods to trans-form raw materials into finished products in the most optimum way. The graduates are equipped with the knowledge and the skill set to work on the products of their choosing from scratch, from the designing of a plant to the optimization of the processes required to the environmental impact through a laborious, industry oriented theoretical and practical curriculum.
