<strong>Guest of honor: Mr. Nitish Kumar Luthra, General Manager, Haldor Topsoe India Pvt. Ltd.</strong>&nbsp;<br>
  <p>On the 17th of October, the Department of Chemical Engineering and the students under it were enlightened about the demand for advancements in the field of hydroprocessing and catlysts. This was carefully taught by Mr. Nitish Kumar Luthra, General Manager at Process Refinery, Development and Engineering Production at Haldor Topsoe. The event began with by following the lighting of the ceremonial lamp and the Sararwati Vandana. The Chancellor Dr. S.J. Chopra and the Head of the Department Dr. I.D. Mall personally welcomed Mr. N.K. Luthra to the university.</p>
  <p> He was clearly impressed by the welcome given to him and appreciated the university and its method of bringing forth budding engineers. Without further ado, he delved into his topic which was “Hydroprocessing: Its needs and Challenges”. For nearly an hour and a half, he captivated the students as they made to understand working of the hydroprocessing profession and the importance of improving the hydroprocessing techniques currently employed. He also explained the history of Haldor Topsoe and how the company manages to satisfy the various orders down to the slightest details for its large no. of customers. He also explained various other topics which included the importance of hydrogen in hydroprocessing, the difference between hydroprocessing and hydro-desulfurization and the various factors that affect the reaction kinetics of the reactions taking place in a reactor. It was quite the interactive session as many relevant questions were raised by students as well as well as from the faculty. </p>
  <p>The event winded up with a summary to recall and jot down the important points discussed during the session. As a form of admiration and veneration, the Chancellor along with the rest of the dignitaries present gifted Mr. N.K. Luthra and his family a small token of respect in the form of a gift. Photographs were clicked and the event concluded with all the dignitaries present leaving for the lunch. The event managed to promote the motive of “teaching beyond the classrooms” and was added as another feather to the cap of the Chapter.<br>
