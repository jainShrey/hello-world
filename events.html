Everyone was set to be the next Mendeleev of today’s world. This event took place on 15th October.<br>
  <p> In this battle of elements , ‘The Periodic Wars’ ,the students had to choose /represent an element from the periodic table and subsequently had to challenge the views of other’s elements. It was one on one debate, where people who chose elements from the same block were clubbed together and they could actually cross question other’s element’s properties.</p>

 The UPES IIChE Student Chapter conducted the event WhizQuiz on 27th August 27, 2015 in room no. 7103 at 1 pm. The event witnessed a participation of nearly 30 people battling it out against the question paper which was carefully set so as to test the wits of the participants to their fullest. The tension in the room could be sensed as the contestants worked their brains to crack the questions. It could be seen on the faces of the students as they walked away from the room that the event had accomplished its task of challenging the domain knowledge of the students and thus was a great success.

<section style="position:relative; right:30px; width:900px; height:240px;"> <img src="../Images/Gallery/IMAG0106.jpg" width="250" height="200" style="float:left;">The IIChE UPES Student Chapter organized Tag Quest! On August 19, 2015 for the first and second year students. The event was a tagline based quiz wherein the students participated in a team of two to guesstimate the companies each tagline belonged to, by jotting down the answers in a restricted timespan. The event served the dual purpose of increasing the student awareness about prevailing Chemical Companies and concurrently testing their power of retention, which when coalesced together, stemmed an event that brought forth a sense of exhilaration, amusement and rush of adrenaline through the participants. Amongst the seventy students who participated in the event, Arvind Kapoor and Mohd. Ozair Ansari emerged triumphant in this battle of sagacity and remembrance. <br>

  <section  style="position:relative; right:30px; width:900px; height:280px;" > 
After nearly a century of oppression, slavery, starvation and poverty, on 15th August 1947 India secured her sovereignty from the claws of the British. Every grandparent loves to tell his grandchildren about how every Indian awoke to a new dawn with the realization that they could breathe the air around them without feeling the need to answer to anyone. But it was a hard-won battle and a terribly saddening one at that because of the spilt blood of India’s sons and daughters that stained her soil and fouled her waters. As a form of respect to our martyrs for their efforts to break India free from the clutches of the British Rule, the IIChE UPES student Chapter held the event “Wordsworth” during the 68th Independence Day celebrations held at UPES. The partakers were asked to express their pride and sorrow about the painful recovery of India’s independence using their words and the feelings they conveyed. The event saw an enthusiastic involvement as entries flooded in. It also accomplished the duty of reinvigorating the feeling of patriotism in the students as the entries that were selected had imparted onto them the true significance of India’s tragic victory.

The IIChE UPES Student Chapter organized “Know-Your-Branch” on August 18, 2015. The guest of honor, was Professor Indra Deo Mall, the new Head of Department of the Chemical Engineering. The event served as a platform for the first and second year students of the chemical engineering branch to interact with such an eminent dignitary. The session involved a look into the developments seen by the chemical engineering domain over the years following India’s breaking of the chains of slavery and colonialism. Professor I.D. Mall also delved into the depths of this vast entity to explain to the students in simple terms about what it signifies to be a part of this reputable domain. Upon retrospection, the session turned out to be informative and the mission to bridge the gap between the students and faculty of the chemical engineering department was successful.
<br>Guest Speaker: Dr. Indra Deo Mall
<br>Event Organizer: Vijay Amarnath
<br>Number of Students: 80
