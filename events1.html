  <h2 style="background-color:#202020;">Chemipedia</h2>
  <section  style="position:relative; right:30px; width:900px; height:180px;"> Quizzes have been an archaic method of testing one‘s general under-standing and aptitude. They not only encourage the students to achieve academic excellence and increase their awareness of the world around them, but are also viewed as the pursuit of trivial knowledge. In its unceasing endeavor to assess and proliferate the knowledge of the existing members, the IIChE UPES Student Chapter organized Chemipedia, a quiz contest on February 19, 2015. The event was conducted in three rounds, each team participating in a faction of two. While the preliminary round focused on examining the quantitative aptitude via a pen and paper quiz comprising of 35 ques-tions; the subsequent rounds were devoted to probing into the partici-pants‘ minds to scrutinize their domain knowledge by means of verbal quiz sessions. After a fiery final round, Prakhar &amp; Gopal emerged victori-ous. The event received an exuberant response with over 50 teams par-ticipating to win the battle of sheer intellect. </section>
