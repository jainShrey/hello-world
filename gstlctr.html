  <section><strong>Guest of honor: Mr. Somaan.</strong>&nbsp;<br>
  It has been a great honour for UPES, Dehradun and IIChE UPES Students Chapter to have been blessed with the esteemed presence of Mr. Somaan on 21st of April, 2016. Mr. Somaan shared his gallons of experience and unfathomable knowledge with the students. With seconds turning into minutes and minutes to hours, the words of wisdom encapsulated the entire hall into the strings of harmony and enlightenment. The topic for the occasion was “refinery operations” which was flawlessly presented among the audience. The session focused on the Industrial application of academic knowledge. Students were exceptionally impressed with his presentation skills. The topic selected for discussion was both apt and interesting. The final session of the day was the highlight of the eve. An interaction between aspiring engineers and giants of the industry is always fruitful and productive. With students putting up their ideas and being fed with solutions from the mainstream industry itself is a treat to watch and be a part of. The overall session was extremely useful and inculcated a sense of enthusiasm among the students in regard of the industrial world. Such sessions should be organized more often.
