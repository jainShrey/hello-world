<p>
The journey towards becoming a chemical engineer requires a regular bringing up-to-date with the alterations in the chemical engineering sphere. The Department of Chemical Engineering in UPES works to achieve this with the help of the IIChE UPES Student Chapter. The department works hand in hand with the chapter to also ease the communication between the students of different years and the faculty.
