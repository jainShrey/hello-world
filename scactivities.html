UPES witnessed the presence of an eminent personality from one of the world’s major technology providers, Honeywell UOP, Mr. Kartik Narayananan, Director (Engineering) at the headquarters of UOP LLC., in Gurgaon. The event commenced with the Saraswati Vandana and the lighting of the ceremonial lamp by Mr. Kartik and some of the most celebrated faculty of the Chemical Department which included Dr. S.J. Chopra, Dr. I.D. Mall, Dr. S.K. Gupta and Dr. P. Vijay. The occasion also had the highpoint of unveiling the first edition of IIChE UPES Student Chapter’s magazine “The Chemical Lifestyle”. Dr. S.J. Chopra welcomed Mr. Kartik to UPES and gave a great introduction about UOP LLC. to the spectators. Dr. I.D. Mall, the HOD of the Chemical Department then took the stage and introduced the guest of honor to the audience. Mr. Kartik took the stage and appreciated Dr. I.D. Mall for preparing a program where he could share his personal views on the crude oil prices, technology drivers and the skill set gap in the Indian workforce. He also appreciated the university about how it develops the students for an industry-centric career. The lecture covered a general area of how the oil market stands and the reasons for its fluctuations. It lasted for an hour and a half as Mr. Kartik carefully explained the world crude situation and how India stands a good chance as an emerging giant under the current conditions. He also talked about how the world and more importantly, India needs more innovative and creative engineers to solve the world’s problems. He also claimed that as engineers, we need to find ways to meet the energy requirements and to meet the ever-growing demands of the public with the resources at hand growing lesser day by day. The attendees of the lecture conducted by Mr. Kartik Suryanarayanan walked away in the end with a clearer picture and a better understanding of the oil economics and the geopolitical reasons behind the fluctuations of the oil prices. The event turned out to be a grand achievement for the IIChE UPES Student Chapter and the Department of Chemical Engineering for it accomplished the objective of teaching the students about the current world scenario and the role of engineering in the advancement of the world.

The IIChE UPES Student Chapter organized “Know-Your-Branch” on August 18, 2015. The guest of honor, was Professor Indra Deo Mall, the new Head of Department of the Chemical Engineering. The event served as a platform for the first and second year students of the chemical engineering branch to interact with such an eminent dignitary. The session involved a look into the developments seen by the chemical engineering domain over the years following India’s breaking of the chains of slavery and colonialism. Professor I.D. Mall also delved into the depths of this vast entity to explain to the students in simple terms about what it signifies to be a part of this reputable domain. Upon retrospection, the session turned out to be informative and the mission to bridge the gap between the students and faculty of the chemical engineering department was successful.
